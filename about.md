My name is Fiifi Arthur and I have been working in the **Data Analytics industry for almost 7 years now**. I'm currently a Data Scientist with a top consulting firm in the heart of London.

The perks of being a Consultant has enabled me to have experience working in industries like:
- Fashion
- Retail
- Finance
- Government
-  Media/Telecoms

In 2015 I began my journey from transitioning from a Data Analyst to a Data Scientist. I wrote a medium blog post about my journey [*here.*](https://medium.com/@fiifi.aarthur/data-analyst-to-data-scientist-1232da18b07c)

 This experience has helped me to **coach several people into landing roles in the Data Science and Data Analytics field**. There has never been a better time in the job market for Data Scientists. Thinking about **upskilling yourself or transitioning into the world of Data Science / AI**, with my services and a little bit of hard work, we can together make that happen for you.
