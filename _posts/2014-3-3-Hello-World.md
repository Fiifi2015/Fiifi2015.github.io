Data Coaching & Training Services In London.

## Bio

My name is Fiifi Arthur and I have been working in the Data Analytics industry for almost 5 years now. I'm current a Data Scientist with a top consulting firm in the heart of London.

The perks of being a Consultant has enabled me to have experience working in industries like Fashion/Retail, Finance, Government and Telecoms.

In 2015 I began my journey from a Data Analyst to become a Data Scientist. I wrote a medium blog post about my journey. [here](https://medium.com/@fiifi.aarthur/data-analyst-to-data-scientist-1232da18b07c)

 This experience has helped me to coach several people into landing roles in the Data Science
